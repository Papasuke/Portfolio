        <li><p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">My name is Mai Duc Minh and my student number is s3681447 and I am honored to be elected as the project leader. I have studied Software Engineering for 6 semesters in RMIT. I usually play video games and listen to music in my free time. Sports are not counted as hobbies for me because I play sports for physical and mental training. I have some IoT experience with Arduino and household networking. I am interested in Python and have a long term plan which aims at machine learning in the medical aspect.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer"></p></li>

      </ul>
      <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1"><span>Both my personal and career life are indicated accurately in the Myers-Briggs test that I am very goal-oriented. “Practice makes perfect”</span> - My strategy is to set a high goal at first, make a concrete plan and push myself hard enough to follow little by little every day. However, the test also discovered a long-standing difficulty of mine, in which my work style would cause a lot of problems to people who are sensitive to criticism since I accidentally react strongly to the work to obtain best results. I am quite a curious person to every phenomenal thing around me so it is unsurprising that the Learning Style Test determines me as a visionary learner. To come up with a clear and detailed teamwork plan, I usually sketch my ideas on paper and make arrangements so that all the thoughts are logged to make sure I do not forget anything. The Big Five Personality test serves as a confirmation of the accuracy of both tests above and comprehensively reflects my personal character, working style so that other teammates can understand and coop better. I am willing to learn from others (decent Openness score), I am less affected to external factors (highest Conscientiousness score), I am very disciplined (lowest Extraversion score) but I am not a good communicator and easily prone to overwhelmed when the plan is off-tracked (high Neuroticism score) <br> As a team member, I can be a responsible person that always try to complete the task with
        best effort as well as contributing to comment for improvements. Moreover, with my
        experience, I can evaluate myself as an omni-purpose member than can take over most of the
        task in the team. As a team leader, I would implement the Waterfall model into teamwork
        and require other members to take high participation to discuss and come up with a detailed
        plan for me. The progress of the tasks is also logged clearly for me to adjust the plan in the
        future. <br> <br>
        <span>Minh’s perspective: </span> I am so honored to be a part of this team and to guide the project to its excellence today. I have created this idea and shared it with my teammates, which I call friends now, and they were all supportive and on board with my idea. We worked endlessly together to complete parts of the project, writing Python codes, getting the marketing department ready and building websites to make it more whole. Right now, I’m happy where we’re at and where we stand with the project. This class has opened up opportunities that were previously unimaginable, that allowed me to meet the best people for the team and work on an idea I knew I wanted to start but didn’t know where to start. And the dream team helped me achieve it. After this class ends, I wonder where we’ll be next, whether it's finishing up the project and putting it on the market or scrapping this to start anew. I think anything would sound appealing with a team like this, and I’m so happy and honored to be a part of this. Together, we set sail for the sea to find copper, and like Columbus, when reaching our destination, what we found wasn’t just copper– it was gold, and of course, the gold is the friendship that was formed along the way.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer"></p>
