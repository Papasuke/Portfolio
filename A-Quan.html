        <li><p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">My name is Vu Quoc Gia Quan, and I have the student ID s3927120. I am currently our team's secretary. I am an IT major, and this is my first semester at RMIT. My hobbies include creating small DIY projects, reading manga, researching random topics, and so on. I do not have much IT knowledge because this is my first time learning programming and IT.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer"></p></li>

      </ul>
      <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1"><span>The Myers-Briggs and a personality test said I am outgoing, analytical, and quick to assess people.</span> But I am strict and do not like unusual answers. The Learning Style test shows that I am a visual learner. Keeping this in mind will help me collaborate with others. Some of my team's ideas may be rejected because they do not meet the textbook's criteria. I need to be more open-minded, but I also need to be more selective with my consumption. Despite my flaws, I enjoy working in a team environment. I can still help others build their own ideas and answers. My ability to elevate ideas and solutions can benefit the entire team. <br> <br>
        <span>Quan’s perspective: </span>Personally, I believe that this is one of the best teams with which I have ever had the pleasure of working. Everyone takes great pride in their work and takes great responsibility for it. Fortunately, we did not encounter many difficulties along the route. Everything went off without a hiccup. All of the people are pleasant and courteous. Our shared interest in memes is quite unexpected, considering how many of us are on the internet. If there is one thing I would change about the project, it would be the way the time is being managed. I wanted it finished sooner rather than later so that we would have more time to make any necessary revisions. Assignment 2 also had some late personal deadline dates that may have been better, but as a result of this, we were able to put together an outline for assignment 3. As a result, we have little to no problems with assignment 3, but it is completed at the expense of spending far too much time on assignment 2 in the process. Aside from the fact that I am delighted with the way we collaborated, there isn't anything to be unhappy about. Overall, I am pleased to work with everyone.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer"></p>
