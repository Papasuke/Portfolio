        <li><p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">My name is Nguyen Thu Thuy, my student number is s3870273 and I am the project manager in the team. I am a Digital Marketing major and this is my fifth semester at RMIT. My hobbies include reading, painting, and writing stories. I like coding although I am still in the learning stage but I am familiar with Python and a little bit of other coding languages.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer"></p></li>

      <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1"><span>The famous Myers-Briggs test convinced me that I am a campaigner, specifically ENFP-A.</span> That means that I am more extroverted and intuitive, and my nature involves more feelings and my type leans towards prospecting. While being quite indecisive, I am assertive with my identity which makes me more confident in my abilities. The second test about the learning style shows that I am a visual learner. The last test was one I chose, the Big Five Personality test, which granted me four factors with an average of 78% (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Agreeableness) and one - Neuroticism - with 17% meaning that I do not often feel negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, emotional instability, etc. <br><br> In a group, I prefer as little drama as possible and work professionally and responsibly. I like people with the same outlook and values as me. But no matter how much I dislike my group, I will never be irresponsible with my work. If my team makes me uncomfortable personally or comes in with insults, I will request to switch teams or find ways to make both me and others comfortable. I really do not appreciate disrespect.
        I already have a team for this class despite not knowing anyone beforehand. One of the members has made a discussion post aiming for a high grade in this course. I believe I have the skills to achieve the same, so I texted them and we have formed our group of four. My teammates are very forward-looking and nice. <br> <br>
        <span>LaLa’s perspective: </span>I honestly really enjoyed my time with the group and I’m sad it has to end. This class was an unexpectedly good journey where I’ve learned the basics and so much more about Information Technology. My semester here with my teammates was surprising and unforgettable. The bond we’ve created both inside and outside of the classroom is amazing, where our whole team treated each other less like work partners and more like friends. As this is my first semester on this campus, I have received so much support from fellow Memeiacs that helped make this campus feel like home. As for working together, I believe we were the most efficient we could be. Each team member contributed a little of their time and skills to make this journey work and work successfully. The idea of creating an image comparison tool is frankly quite interesting and new, and the team made it happen. I learned so much from each friend, and received not only excellent feedback or help on work but also life, laughs, and memes. My teammates are pearls found in the sea. There are people who can work together perfectly, there are people who click together on a personal level and I’m so glad to find those that can be both.
